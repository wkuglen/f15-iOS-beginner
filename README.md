# iOS Beginner, Fall 2015
Class materials and projects. Course overview (which will be highly responsive to the class' needs and will likely change) is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rhag5U3ojIyiubxnb8T6mIxjxCFUWx-8iT2HKg2Vj28/edit?usp=sharing).

Everything will be indexed by the number of workshop. Projects will be committed at the end of every session, overwriting the previous version. The repo will be tagged at the beginning of each session to let you know where we started.
